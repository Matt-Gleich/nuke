‚ò¢Ô∏è Force quit all applications with one terminal command.

# ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING ‚ö†Ô∏è

`nuke` does a hard process kill on the application. All that this means is if you have any unsaved work then it will be lost after running this command, there is no prompt to save.

# üöÄ Install

Simply run `brew tap Matt-Gleich/homebrew-taps` and then `brew install nuke`
